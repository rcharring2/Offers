This is a Java web application that utilizes Spring Framework to create a craigslist-style webpage.

This project is currently running on the RedHat cloud. If you would like to view it, use this link:

(It may take longer than usual to load, but it will load).

I used a local MySQL database in order to run the project locally. If you would like to get it running locally, you will also have 
to create one and make the necessary changes in the code. 

Enjoy!
